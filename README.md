## Model Approaches

### Primary Model: CatBoost Quantile Regression
- **Method**: Gradient boosting with quantile loss functions
- **Uncertainty**: Full distributional predictions with empirical quantiles
- **Features**: Intervention conditioning + interaction terms
- **Validation**: Leave-one-out cross-validation

### Comparative Models (Optional)
1. **Simple Average**: Baseline using mean of other control arms
2. **Ratio Method**: Fixed proportion of intervention outcome (70% default)
3. **Random Forest**: Ensemble method with intervention conditioning  
4. **Lasso Regression**: L1-regularized linear model with interactions

## Key Performance Metrics

### Clinical Relevance
- **Directional Accuracy**: % of trials where ATE sign is predicted correctly (most important)
- **RÂ² for ATE**: Goodness of fit for treatment effect predictions
- **Spearman Correlation**: Rank-order correlation (robust to outliers)

### Prediction Quality
- **RMSE**: Root mean squared error for absolute accuracy
- **Coverage**: % of true values falling within predicted confidence intervals
- **Calibration**: How well predicted probabilities match actual outcomes

### Uncertainty Quantification
- **CI Width**: Average width of confidence intervals (precision)
- **P(ATE > 0)**: Probability of positive treatment effect
- **IoU**: Intersection over Union with actual confidence intervals (when available)

## Feature Engineering

The pipeline automatically creates engineered features:

### Treatment Features
- `combo_therapy`: Multi-drug treatment indicator
- `treatment_complexity`: Number of different drug classes
- `novelty_score`: First-in-class + next-generation indicator

### Patient Risk Features  
- `high_risk_profile`: Brain metastases or Stage IV disease
- `elderly_male`: Age > 60 and male > 60%
- `smoker_percent`: Derived from non-smoker percentage

### Interaction Terms
- `int_outcome_x_egfr`: Intervention outcome Ã— EGFR TKI treatment
- `int_outcome_x_immuno`: Intervention outcome Ã— Immunotherapy

## Configuration

Customize the pipeline behavior using a JSON configuration file:

```json
{
  "target": "PFS_median_months",
  "feature_groups_to_use": ["patient_demographics", "disease_characteristics", "drug_class"],
  "features": {
    "patient_demographics": ["gender_male_percent", "age_median", "no_smoker_percent"],
    "disease_characteristics": ["brain_metastase_yes", "disease_stage_IV"],
    "drug_class": ["EGFR_TKI", "PD1_PDL1_Inhibitor", "Chemotherapy"]
  },
  "interaction_terms": [
    {"name": "int_outcome_x_egfr", "feature1": "intervention_outcome", "feature2": "EGFR_TKI"}
  ]
}
```

## Research Background

This pipeline implements the methodology developed in the research notebooks, specifically:

### Leave-One-Out Protocol
1. **Target Selection**: Choose one RCT to predict (hold-out)
2. **Training Set**: Use control arms from all other RCTs
3. **Prediction**: Predict held-out trial's control arm outcome
4. **ATE Calculation**: Compare predicted control vs actual intervention outcome
5. **Evaluation**: Compare predicted ATE with actual ATE

### Intervention Conditioning
A key innovation is using the intervention arm outcome as a conditional feature:
- Adds intervention outcome as a feature for all control arms
- Creates interaction terms between intervention outcome and drug classes
- Enables the model to adjust predictions based on intervention effectiveness

### Uncertainty Quantification
Rather than point estimates, the model provides:
- Full probability distributions via quantile regression
- Confidence intervals at multiple levels (80%, 90%, 95%)
- Probability of positive treatment effect
- Coverage analysis for model calibration

## Clinical Applications

### Trial Design
- **Go/No-Go Decisions**: Use directional accuracy for treatment promising assessment
- **Sample Size Planning**: Use control arm predictions for power calculations
- **Endpoint Selection**: Leverage uncertainty estimates for realistic planning

### Portfolio Management
- **Trial Prioritization**: Rank trials by probability of positive ATE
- **Resource Allocation**: Focus on trials with highest expected treatment effects
- **Risk Assessment**: Use confidence intervals for investment decisions

### Regulatory Strategy
- **Benchmark Setting**: Compare new trials against predicted control performance
- **Success Probability**: Quantify likelihood of meeting primary endpoints
- **Evidence Planning**: Use uncertainty estimates for evidence generation strategies

## Limitations and Considerations

### Data Requirements
- Requires historical RCT data with consistent endpoints
- Performance depends on similarity between historical and target trials
- Limited to progression-free survival as primary endpoint

### Model Assumptions
- Assumes control arm outcomes are predictable from trial characteristics
- Leave-one-out validation may be optimistic for very different trial populations
- Feature engineering is tailored to lung cancer trials

### Clinical Context
- Predictions are estimates and should inform, not replace, clinical judgment
- External validity depends on representativeness of training data
- Regulatory acceptance may vary by indication and geography

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Import Errors**: Ensure all packages are installed with correct versions
```bash
pip install -r pipeline_requirements.txt
```

**Excel File Format**: Check that sheets "trials by arm" and "250529_NSCLC" exist
- Verify column names match expected format
- Ensure `NCT_ID`, `Arm`, `PFS_median_months` columns are present

**Missing Data**: Pipeline handles missing values but requires core columns
- `PFS_median_months`: Target variable (required)
- `NCT_ID`: Trial identifier (required) 
- `Arm`: Treatment arm designation (required)

**Memory Issues**: For large datasets, consider:
- Running without comparative models (`include_comparisons=False`)
- Reducing the number of quantiles in CatBoost configuration
- Processing subsets of trials separately

### Performance Optimization

**Speed Up Training**:
- Set `include_comparisons=False` to run only CatBoost model
- Reduce CatBoost iterations in configuration
- Use fewer quantiles for uncertainty quantification

**Improve Accuracy**:
- Ensure high-quality feature engineering
- Validate that intervention outcomes are available for all trials
- Check for data quality issues in key features
